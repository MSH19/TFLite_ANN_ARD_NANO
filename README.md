Saleh, Mahdi (2024). TFLite_ANN_ARD_NANO v1.0. figshare. Software. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26472619           

A demonstration on the process of creating, converting, and running an Artificial Neural Network model on an Arduino NANO 33 BLE module.        

To create the model, train it, and converted it to TFLite models and header files, check the model_colab folder.    

To run the model on the Arduino module, use Arduino IDE, compile, and run the project included in the test_1 folder on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE module.

TensorflowLite library should be added to the Arduino IDE (library Zip file is included in library folder) or can be downloaded from: https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro-arduino-examples
