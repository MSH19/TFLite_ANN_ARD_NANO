# TFLite_ANN_ARD_NANO
Running artificial neural network model on Arduino Nano 33 BLE    

To create the model, train it, and converted it to int8 header file, check the model_colab folder.    

To run the model, use Arduino IDE, compile, and run the project on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE module.

TensorflowLite library should be added to the Arduino IDE (library Zip file is included in library folder) or can be downloaded from : https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro-arduino-examples
